    "1. In Canvas, make an assignment called polleverywhere that has as many points as the percentage of final grade, which should also be equal the value of polleverywhere scores. \n",
    "2. In 'Grades' (in Canvas), select 'Actions: Export' to download a csv file.\n",
    "3. Rename that file as 'canvas.csv' and move it to the root path (defined below).\n",
    "4. Open canvas.csv in excel, or other such app, and copy the name of the column that holds your polleverywhere scores. Paste that name in the cell below (in quotes) for the cn_fieldname variable.\n",
    "5. Place all polleverywhere CSV files in a folder called 'polleverywhere csv files', within the root directory. Polleverywhere allows exporting in a hierarchical way, so you could have just one file. However, it's probably easier to keep things organized by periodically adding a new CSV file, rather than overwriting the old one with a bigger csv file.\n",
    "6. In the cell below (\"Inititialize packages . . \"), update all paths and variables.\n",
    "7. Run all cells to generate 'canvas_upload.csv'\n",
    "8. In 'Grades', select 'Actions: Import' to upload the scores and follow the instructions."

    "2. Keep adding CSV files from polleverywhere into the 'polleverywhere CSV files' folder, as they are generated\n",
    "3. Switching between users will require changing the root path, so comment out the root path and define your own when you switch \n",
    "4. Don't forget to download canvas_upload.csv after running the code (give it a minute or two to update first) and then upload it to Canvas to update the scores.\n",
    "5. Note that the 'Grade' scores from polleverywhere are normalized by the 'participation' score, so it's okay if some of the questions do not end up getting used in class."
